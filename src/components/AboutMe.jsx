        Hey, I'm <span className="font-semibold text-white">Mayank Doholiya</span>, an undergraduate Computer Science student and full-stack developer who loves building and shipping things that people actually use.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        I mainly work with <span className="text-blue-400">React.js</span>, <span className="text-blue-400">Next.js</span>, and <span className="text-blue-400">Node.js</span> for both frontend and backend, using <span className="text-yellow-400">TypeScript</span> alongside them. I have created many cool projects using these technologies.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-2">
        If you have an idea and would like to collaborate, feel free to DM me! I'm always open and ready to connect and work on exciting projects. Also, be sure to check out my other side, just click on the navbar image!

          Outside of code, Iâ€™m constantly exploring new ideas in design, gaming mechanics, and digital storytelling. Whether itâ€™s analyzing cinematic shots or losing track of time on a puzzle, I love things that make you think differently. I also enjoy writing and reflecting on my tech journeyâ€”maybe one day I'll publish a blog or two!
